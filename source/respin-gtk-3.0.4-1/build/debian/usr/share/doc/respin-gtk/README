Limitations of remastering
========================== 

Due to some common questions I keep getting asked repeatedly I have put the answers here.

There are some limitations for remastering right now and they have absolutely nothing to do with Respin itlself.

1 - Nvidia and ATI proprietary drivers are disabled at the kernel level by ubuntu's casper scripts - no workaround

2 - limit of 4Gig for any single file on the iso file which is a limitation of the iso9660 spec which means the 
compressed filesystem must be 4G or less - no workaround

3 - no official text mode installer for the livecd so all remasters that you want to be able to install must have a gui
- no workaround

4 - Install options limited to what Ubuntu's installer, Ubiquity can do - no workaround

5 - In order for the Ubuntu casper scripts to create and boot into the livecd user, either gdm or kdm must be used
as the login manager - no workaround

6 - the livecd is limited to 1 iso file as casper only look for a single filesystem.squashfs file - no workaround

7 - compression level of the filesystem.squashfs doesn't have lzma as the Ubuntu kernel and mksquashfs would need
to be patched - unsupported/no workaround.

8 - livecd only works properly with linux-generic livecd kernel - if you make your own kernel you are on your own
- unsupported so please don't ask for help with this

9 - if it isn't in the normal Ubuntu repositories or requires a patch of an app that changes it from stock ubuntu apps
it is completely unsupported so please don't ask me for help with these

10 - there are certain apps and libraries that Ubuntu doesn't have on their livecd's and for whatever reason they
cause the livecd to fail if they are installed - no workaround

11 - if your customizations are not showing up on the livecd then it means you have not made the changes in the
correct place.  You must figure out what files need to be changed or where the global configuration of the settings
are that you are trying to change.  I only use KDE so I couldn't answer any gnome related questions anyway.
- you are on your own.

I have no intentions of maintaining a fork of casper or ubiquity or any other app so please don't ask me to change
any of the above.  I make respin which helps you remaster a base Ubuntu desktop live system and thats it.

These are not limitations of respin but rather the underlying tools that are used to remaster the
livecd/run the livecd/install the livecd.

These may change in the future if Ubuntu changes them but for now they are the limitations and there are no workarounds.

Respin simply builds the livecd from the system you are running.  If you have it setup correctly and
nothing conflicts with Ubuntu's casper or ubiquity then it should build, run and install just fine.

 
Information About Dist Mode
===========================

The dist mode of respin is unsupported for the most part.

I have tested respin on stock installs of Ubuntu, Kubuntu and usually Xubuntu as well.

Normal i386 and amd64 versions so I know respin works on stock installs.

Most problems in dist mode are created by yourself due to customization or package choice.

These issues have nothing to do with respin.
They conflict with Ubuntu's casper livecd boot tool and Ubuntu's ubiquity installer and those aren't
going to be changed to suit your needs.  If you want to make changes to them, you will need to fork
those projects off on your own.
